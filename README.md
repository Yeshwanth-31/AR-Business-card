# AR-Business-card
This project transforms the traditional business card into an interactive experience using Augmented Reality (AR). By scanning a QR code on the card, users are directed to a web-based AR scene where they can explore 3D models of the organizationâ€™s logo, social media icons (like Instagram), and contact details (via a 3D phone model).

NOTE: The experience is accessible through a smartphone browser, with no app required.
